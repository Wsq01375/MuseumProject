# **Unwrapped**
## * *Here to Unwrap Art History* *

## *Purpose of the Site*

The website for our company, Unwrapped, is to “unwrap art history” and to showcase many great art pieces for the visual pleasure of others. We want to give people of all ages a chance to experience art that many may look past. Many museums and art websites focus on painting, sculptures, and other art pieces that are well known or from time periods that are well known. However, we thought that some of the best art that is out there needs to come out of hiding and be showcased for people to see. We have a range of diverse art pieces on our site which include Chinese art, Native American art, American art, and Indian art. The curiosity of our audience will drive us to unveil more and more art pieces that are being left in the dark.

##*Audience of the Site*

The website showcases art pieces from different ethnic groups and from different times in history. We believe that the audience that would use the site are people who want experiences. This would either entail individual or group experiences that would bring excitement and curiosity to those on our site. We hope they will stay and learn about the many cultures that are on display that many museums and websites do not have to offer. When looking at the two personas that we created to show exactly the type of people that would enjoy our site, you can see that they are different in their own ways. Despite their differences, our site will bring them enjoyment because they can experience new things. The first persona enjoys everything and makes things fun for others, and the second persona is very sociable and demonstrates leadership ability. More information on the two personas follows. 


### Persona 1 (ESRP)

Persona 1’s Myers-Briggs personality type is Extraversion, Sensing, Feeling, Perceiving (ESFP). This type is outgoing, accepting, friendly, and enjoys having fun with others. They are invested in their surroundings, and join in eagerly with others.  They are best in situations that need sound common sense and practical ability with people. Abigail is an example of this type of personality. She is newly retired after working for 30 years, and wants to explore new things with the time she has. She is looking for new adventures and more social interactions. Although she is retired, she babysits her grandchildren who are teaching her how to use the web, and our website is perfect for her to explore new things.

### Persona 2 (ENFJ)

Persona 2’s Myers-Briggs personality type is Extraversion, Intuition, Feeling, and Judging (ENFJ). They are responsive and responsible. They are concerned for what others want, and try to handle things with due regard for the other’s feelings. ENFJ’s are creative idea generators and demonstrate leadership ability.  Because they are sociable, popular, sympathetic, they like to facilitate others and enable people to achieve their potential. Joe Bob is an example of this type of personality. He is a college student at St. John Fisher College and works as both a Starbucks barista as well as a tutor in the Mac lab. He is easily bored and can be very unfocused, but when he finds many interests in things.

## *Competitive Analysis*

When our team decided to pursue a museum website, we knew we had to look at competitors of us that shared similar ideas. The reason for this is to see what we have that these places didn’t have. The three museums that our team looked at were the Morgan Library & Museum, the New York Path through History, and the Smithsonian. 

The Morgan Library & Museum shows off art and education at the same time. It is very intimate and has a smaller curated collection. The main navigation links of their website are Visit, Exhibitions, Programs, Collection, Research, About, Support, and Shop. Their homepage is filled with intimate collection of arts and book manuscripts. They are also very relevant in many social media outlets, which is a very important step for any type of business. These platforms include Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Trip Advisor, and Google Culture. To actually visit the museum, it costs $22 for adults and it is free on Friday for anyone visiting. We believe that their desired market demographic are art enthusiasts and students who have a want to expand their horizon. 

The New York Path through History wants people to be able to find their own individual-historical experience. The main navigation links for their website are Themes, Attractions, Events, By Region, and Map. Their homepage is filled with imagery that is engaging, easy to navigate, and very family oriented. The one down side that they have is that they are not on any social media platform, which means that most of their users are learning about the website from other people who have been on it. Their desired market demographic are families that want to have a weekend experience in the state of New York.
The Smithsonian’s purpose for their website is to have a large collection of museums within it that shows a rich cultural heritage. The main navigation links of the website are Visit, What’s On, Learn and Explore, Get Involved, and About. The homepage is filled with imagery that is engaging, colorful, and easy to navigate. They are very active on social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter, and YouTube. The pricing to go to the museum is free, unless visitors want to go to certain exhibitions that make you buy tickets. We believe that the desired market demographic are art enthusiasts, US and foreign tourists, and students who want to experience the arts.
After carefully looking at these three websites and realizing what their strengths and weaknesses are, we were able to make our website the best it could be. We adopted the “experience” theme from the New York Path Through History Site.  From that sight we also took our inspiration from images and how they offered an alternative, easy-to-use navigational aid. The Morgan Library site has impactful images, so we carefully selected the images for their vibrant color, and interesting artistry. The Smithsonian site was more difficult to navigate because the most current exhibit took up the entire home page. We did not want to adopt that approach.

Our goal was to provide an uncomplicated site that curated different art treasures from around the world. We coupled that with an opportunity to plan a museum-focused travel experience. I believe our website incorporates many of the strengths of our competitors with a little creativity of our own.

## *Informational Architecture*

Below is the informational architecture that we created when we first started to think about what we wanted to make our website, Unwrapped, look like. However, things don’t always go according to plan in a business setting especially if we knew the changes would be more beneficial. So below is what we first thought are website would contain, but when you take a look at our actual website, it will be different in order to give our users a more impactful experience. We focused on Native America, American, Indian, Chinese. We also added a Contact page to the Home page and all subsequent pages.

## *Usability Testing*

In class on December 5th, we completed the usability testing for our website with the help of many students. At first, we had three questions or tasks for people to do when looking at the site. Those tasks were; find where you can plan your trip and tell us if it’s helpful, how does the homepage look, and find Native American art and tell us your favorite. However, the home button of our website was not working properly, so after we asked the students to do our tasks, we let them explore themselves and tell us what we needed to fix or what they like about it, and these were the results. 

Every person who looked at our website said that they liked our layout, but wanted to see us fill in the white spaces on the contact page. We also need to get a new image for the contact page, make sure all of the text fits in the text boxes, add “Click on image…” to make sure people know how to look at the art, and change 24x7 to 24/7. The usability testing was very helpful for us as a team because it allowed us to see our website from other people’s point of views. The criticism we received for our site will allowed us to fix things to make Unwrapped the best website it can be and more.

## *Conclusion*

The Unwrapped website that we have created as a team is the start of something that could be great for museum and art lovers around the world. This initial design still needs a lot of work done to it in order to move forward and give our users the real sense of unwrapping art history. We believe that as a team, we can perfect this website with a couple of ideas for the development phase. With the help of the students from the usability testing, we know that there are a couple minor changes that can help with the website.

As a team, we came up with a couple ideas to finish our site completely, and those are:

* Search capability
* FAQ’s
* Add social media outlets (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, etc.)
* Blog
* Reviews
* Change certain sized images and texts on the different pages to help in eliminating scrolling

This way more people will stay on the website because what they’re reading is short, but to the point.

With these changes, we believe it will help our website be efficient, effective, and promote learning to people all around the world. The Unwrapped website will be the best museum/art website out there, and will give people the chance to unwrap art history for themselves.
